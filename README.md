Created to track my language-learning progress, this script allows a user to see an analysis of the Chinese characters they have learned or memorized.

To use:
- To extract individual characters from an Anki deck, run anki_deck_extractor.py
- For other texts, run chinese_text_metrics.py

Current features:
- Character extraction and junk removal
- Tracking a count of total unique characters
- Differentiation between simplified and traditional character sets

Planned features:
- Complexity estimation: comparison with the most frequently-used characters
