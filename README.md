When provided input text data, this script runs an analysis of Chinese characters within the file.

Created to track my language-learning progress. I use it to see how many unique characters I've learned, by uploading my full Anki decks.

To use:
- To extract individual characters from an Anki deck, run anki_deck_extractor.py
- For other texts, run chinese_text_metrics.py

Current features:
- Character extraction and junk removal
- Tracking a count of total unique characters
- Differentiation between simplified and traditional character sets

Wishlist features:
- Complexity estimation: comparison with the top 1000 most frequently-used Chinese characters
